# Understanding a Restaurant’s Digital Footprint on Social Media
**Project Contributors:** Chiraag Kala, Omar AlShaye, and Dan McDonough

**Business Opportunity -  The images and posts people share about restaurants matter, and it is important that restaurants understand their digital data on social media.**
* There are over 341M posts for #food and 199M posts for #foodporn on Instagram
* When choosing a restaurant, Gen Z and Millennials are 99 percent more likely to rely on social media and online reviews than Gen X and Boomers. 
* Nearly 72% of customers have used Facebook to make restaurant decisions, based on comments and images that have been shared by other users.
* A one-star increase in a restaurant’s Yelp rating can result in as much as a 9 percent increase in revenue.

**Product Idea**
1. For a given restaurant, scrape all the images shared on social media (Instagram location tags, restaurant hashtag, Facebook location tag, etc.)
2. Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify all the images into the following categories - food, drink, inside, and outside and return the summary statistics to the restaurant

**Dataset Used** - Yelp has an all-purpose dataset online for an ongoing competition, which has 200,000 images and over 6.6M reviews collected from 10 major cities across the US.
